# Ideal Gas Simulation


This project essentially emulates a container with three different types
of particles and allows the user to interact with verious properties to view the
effect on variables such as speed, temperature, and heat energy. The right and left
arrow keys can be used to change the heat energy in the system while the up and down
arrow keys change the temperature in the system. The enter or return key toggles gravity 
on or off in the simulation. There are histograms displaying the velocities of particles 
in real time as well as phase change graphs also updated in real time depending on user 
input.
